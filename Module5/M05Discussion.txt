Part A:
    Question 1:
        Write assignment statements that perform the following operations with the variables a, b, and c.
        a. Adds 2 to a and stores the result in b
            w
    Question 2:
        Assume the variables result, w, x, y, and z are all integers, and that w = 5,  x= 4,  y = 8, and z = 2. What value will be stored in result after each of the following statements execute?
        a. result = x + y
        b. result = z * 2
        c. result = y / x
        d. result = y â€“ z
        e. result = w // z

Part B:
    Question 1: 
        Write a Python statement that assigns the sum of 10 and 14 to the variable total
        var total = 10 + 14
    Question 2
        Write a Python statement that subtracts the variable down_payment from the variable total and assigns the result to the variable due
    Question 3
        Write a Python statement that  multiplies the variable subtotal by 0.15 and assigns the result to the variable total
    Question 4
        Assume the variable sales references a float value. Write a statement that displays the value rounded to two decimal points
