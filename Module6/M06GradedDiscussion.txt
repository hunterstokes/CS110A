Instructions:
    In this discussion forum you will explore freely accessible big datasets and consider what information you could learn from the data.
    Step 1: Choose a Dataset
        Find an online, freely available "big data" set that interests you. There are lots of datasets available. Below are some example websites/datasets, but there are many, many more out there. Download the dataset and review it. 

    Step 2: Think of Questions
        Think at least two questions that you could answer by analyzing your dataset.
        Note: you are not actually analyzing or finding the answer! Just think of what questions could be answered.

    Step 3: Make Your Post
    In your post, include:
        the name of your dataset
        a link to the dataset
        a brief (1-2 sentence) description of the dataset
        the two questions
    
    Step 4: Respond to a Post
        Respond to at least one other student's post. In your response post, think of an additional question that could be answered with their dataset.
